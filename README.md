# Overstock

A mod for [VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/), a
Minecraft-inspired open-source survival sandbox game built on the
[Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) engine.

This mod adds **storage crates**, a block which holds up to 64 stacks of a
single item. Rather than open an inventory screen, you right or left click on
the block to put items in or take items out.

- Right-click to add a stack.
- Double right-click to add all the items in your inventory of that type.
- Punch to take a stack.
- Sneak-punch to take a single item.

VoxeLibre and Minetest Game are supported, and other games may work as well if
you register a crafting recipe.

Storage crates currently do not support VoxeLibre hoppers or other mods that
interact with inventories. Support for hoppers may be added in the future.

Inspired by barrels from the Minecraft mod Factorization and later
implementations such as JABBA.
