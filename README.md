# Essentia

A collection of mods for
[VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/), a
Minecraft-inspired open-source survival sandbox game built on the
[Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) engine.

Leaning away from the power creep of popular Minecraft mods, this pack aims to
be balanced against the base game.

## Mods
