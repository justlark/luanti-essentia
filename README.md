# Essentia

A collection of mods for
[VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/), a
Minecraft-inspired open-source survival sandbox game built on the
[Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) engine.

Leaning away from the power creep of popular Minecraft mods, this pack aims to
be balanced against the base game.

## Mods

### Overstock

**A block which stores large quantities of a single item.**

This mod adds **storage crates**, a block which holds up to 64 stacks of a
single item. Rather than open an inventory screen, you right or left click on
the block to put items in or take items out.

- Right-click to add a stack.
- Double right-click to add all the items in your inventory of that type.
- Punch to take a stack.
- Sneak-punch to take a single item.

VoxeLibre is an optional dependency only to provide a crafting recipe. This mod
should be usable with most games if you register a crafting recipe.
